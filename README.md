# NASA space apps challenge 2020 - Team Random 
## Project S.M.Art: Space and Mars merged into Art!

In this project we have 2 parts where we needed to code:
1) In the first folder, we have the mars vr projects. Mars2.Unity and Future.Unity are the unity scenes that are used to create the vr

2) In the neural style transfer file, we have the python and tensorflow code, that has been used to create the face musk.
